# HashRiddle
This project tries to provide a marketplace for solving hash-riddles on ethereum.

It's my first project in solidity and on github so feel free to tell me where im wrong/doing stupid beginner mistakes. 

The code right now isn't really code yet. I just wrote down my basic ideas in PDL and hope to elaborate on them in the future and break it down into more actionable steps. Ultimately the goal is to write the code in solidity and deploy it to the ethereum main chain. I hope to learn things and maybe people will find it usefull in the end.
